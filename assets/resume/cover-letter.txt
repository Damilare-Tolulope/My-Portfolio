Dear Hiring manager,

This letter is to express my interest in the job posted online for an experienced, junior and senior javascript developer. As you'll see, I have about 3 years of hands-on experience efficiently coding websites and applications using modern HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript including JavaScript frameworks like ReactJs.

Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent addition to your organization. In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work to all of my employers, including those I've worked for on a project basis.
I’ve attached a copy of my resume detailing my experience, along with links to websites and applications I’ve had the honor of working on.

My desired number of working hours per week is between the range of 20-30hours which implies working 4-5 hours daily for 6days.

I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, +2348074270190 or by email at damilaretolulope1@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Best regards,


Ajele Oluwadamilare.
